# Year-3-Projects

This directory contains two pdfs files showing my 3rd year university projects during my Theoretical Physics Degree.

The anisotropy of commercial YBCO was proven by varying the angle between incident B field and the Copper oxide planes. It 
showed the two-dimensionality of YBCO’s superconductivity. The Tc decreased from (90.9±0.5)K to (89.8±0.6)K when the B field 
was at a Maxima. Macroscopic strains were applied on 3d printed bridges in No field and Tc did not change. When a B field was 
applied to the highest strain the Tc became (88.8±0.5)K. B field intensity on CuO2 has a negative correlation to Tc. The degrees of 
freedom in the experiment where reduced and showed that the largest contribution to error was the angle between the B field and the 
Copper oxide plane. BCS theory and the modern take on cuprate superconductivity was discussed

Models were compared to the TOV mass limit of neutron stars. Model 3 has been TOV corrected. It switches its equation 
of state EoS for central pressures larger than (1.0976606±0.0000001) ∙1035 Pa. Model 4 is the combined state of the non
relativistic and relativistic states, that has a continuous EoS transition. It’s mass is (0.9585±0.0005)M☉ and its curve fit 
constants are  ANR=6247.4472±0.04 & AR_=0.00085±0.00007. Model five includes nuclear potentials from the binding 
energies of the fermi neutron gases and has an approximate maximum mass of 2.2 M☉.  The nuclear compressibility and 
purity of the neutron star were varied to see their effects of maximum mass.
